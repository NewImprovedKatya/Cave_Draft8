          Hello there, and welcome to{" "}
          <span class="bold">
            Collaborative Artistic Ventures Entertainment! 
          </span>
                  Here at CAVE, we are working to facilitate a growing network of underrepresented artists who struggle to find work independently because they are unable to meet the social demands of traditional networking. At the moment, CAVE is working to connect creators who want to work on larger projects with a team of like-minded individuals. In addition to providing a safe environment for creators to work, CAVE has several ways to get involved.

Official CAVE projects will be fully collaborative in nature. The idea is for creators to work together to build larger projects than many of us are able to complete individually, and any money earned from the project will be split between the project’s members. How much each member gets will be decided by the project’s members as well while CAVE will retain a small percentage to fund additional projects. Keep in mind that it will take time for these projects to get off the ground, so it is not advisable to rely on them as a source of income. Anyone can make suggestions for these projects, but all official projects will be managed by CAVE.
                  Many people who join our collaborative will have projects of their own that they’ve put a lot of time and effort into. These are considered personal projects, not official CAVE projects. Helping a collaborator with a personal project is voluntary and not necessary to participate in official CAVE projects. However, helping someone with their personal project is a great way to make connections and find people to help with your own personal project. It’s also the quickest way to get involved and make connections.

CAVE will also host various competitions in an effort to facilitate growth and cooperation and to support the community and its members. These competitions will always have a monetary reward, and while winners can do what they like with their earnings, putting the funds back into the CAVE community by hiring other collaborators to work on a personal project is highly encouraged. 

However you decide to participate, I hope you’re able to find community and acceptance here at CAVE. CAVE is in its infancy and will require time to grow, but the more people who join, the sooner projects can begin!
